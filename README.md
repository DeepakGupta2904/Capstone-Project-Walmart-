# Capstone-Project-Walmart-

I am done this project as a Data Scientist Intern at Intellipaat Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd.

Project Overview:- Walmart is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, department stores and grocery stores. As of Jul 2019, Walmart has 11,200 stores in 27 countries with revenues exceeding $500 billion. A challenge facing the retail industry such as Walmartâ€™s is to ensure the supply chain and warehouse space usage is optimized to ensure supply meets demand effectively, especially during spikes such as the holiday seasons. This is where accurate sales forecasting enable companies to make informed business decisions. Companies can base their forecasts on past sales data, industry-wide comparisons and economic trends. However, a forecasting challenge is the need to make decisions based on limited history. If Christmas comes but once a year, so does the chance to see how strategic decisions impacted the bottom line.


Problem Statement:- A retail store that has multiple outlets across the country are facing issues in managing the inventory - to match the demand with respect to supply.

a. If the weekly sales are affected by the unemployment rate, if yes - which stores are suffering the most?

b. If the weekly sales show a seasonal trend, when and what could be the reason?

c. Does temperature affect the weekly sales in any manner?

d. How is the Consumer Price index affecting the weekly sales of various stores?

e. Top performing stores according to the historical data.

f. The worst performing store, and how significant is the difference between the highest and lowest performing stores.
