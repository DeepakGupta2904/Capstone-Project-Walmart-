Project Overview:- Walmart is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, department stores and grocery stores. As of Jul 2019, Walmart has 11,200 stores in 27 countries with revenues exceeding $500 billion. A challenge facing the retail industry such as Walmart’s is to ensure the supply chain and warehouse space usage is optimized to ensure supply meets demand effectively, especially during spikes such as the holiday seasons. This is where accurate sales forecasting enable companies to make informed business decisions. Companies can base their forecasts on past sales data, industry-wide comparisons and economic trends. However, a forecasting challenge is the need to make decisions based on limited history. If Christmas comes but once a year, so does the chance to see how strategic decisions impacted the bottom line.

Project Objective:- The purpose of this study is to predict the weekly sales for Walmart based on available historical data (collected between 2010 to 2013) from 45 stores located in different regions around the country. Each store contains a number of departments and the main deliverable is to predict the weekly sales for all such departments.
Problem Statement:- A retail store that has multiple outlets across the country are facing issues in managing the inventory - to match the demand with respect to supply.

In this project, I am Use statistical analysis, EDA, outlier analysis, and handle the missing values to come up with various insights that can give them a clear perspective on the following:-

a. If the weekly sales are affected by the unemployment rate, if yes - which stores are suffering the most?

b. If the weekly sales show a seasonal trend, when and what could be the reason?

c. Does temperature affect the weekly sales in any manner?

d. How is the Consumer Price index affecting the weekly sales of various stores?

e. Top performing stores according to the historical data.

f. The worst performing store, and how significant is the difference between the highest and lowest performing stores.

Conclusion of Project:- The main purpose of this study was to predict Walmart’s sales based on the available historic data and identify whether factors like temperature, unemployment, fuel prices, etc affect the weekly sales of particular stores under study. This study also aims to understand whether sales are relatively higher during holidays like Christmas and Thanksgiving than normal days so that stores can work on creating promotional offers that increase sales and generate higher revenue.
